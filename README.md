Clockwork-ShuffleSeg

Clockwork-ShuffleSeg is (or ... should be) a light-weight semantic segmentation network designed for real-time augmented reality application

readTXT.py: well ... kindda useless
layers.py: the layers used in the network.
network.py: the network itself
evaluate.py: some functions used to compute cost and mIoU
train.py: as the name suggests, it is used to train the network (INCOMPLETE)

TODO:
1. Finish train.py
2. Manage data
3. Create functions for testing, validating and deployment
